How will you explain inheritance to your parents?

   The standard definiion!
   
>"The process by which one class acquires the properties(data members) and functionalities(methods) of another class is called inheritance."
OR
"Inheritance is a process of defining a new class based on an existing class by extending its common data members and methods."
---> Let's understand it in a very common WAY!!(in contrast to the programming way)
     >Here, CLASS means MOM & DAD (a class here is nothing but a piece of code having some functions to do).
            PROPERTIES & FUNCTIONALITIES means TRITES or GENETICS.
           
           -->Just like how a child acquires trites of his/her parents which is called to be INHERITANCE, in a program a
               class can give away its properties to be used by an other class. 
           -->Just like how we normally say that a paticular parent and child pair have some common TRITES or if they                        resemble eachother, it is because of inheritance. 
           
     The standard definiion!
     

>Child Class:
The class that extends the features of another class is known as child class, sub class or derived class.

-->Again, a CHILD can inherit TRITES of his/her PARENTS.
            Such class which acquired any properties from other class is called the CHILD class.
      

>Parent Class:
The class whose properties and functionalities are used(inherited) by another class is known as parent class, super class or Base class.

-->Again, PARENTS have their CHILDREN/CHILD with some COMMON trites due to inheritance.

                                                        |
