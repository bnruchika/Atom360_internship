 Assume you are a story teller and a crocodile is listening to your
story. Can you think of 3 ways to count the no of teeth of the crocodile ?


1. I will narrate the story to the crocodile on a sunny day!:p
    Crocodiles love basking in the sun and they open their mouth wide open and rest! 
    And hence, I can count their teeth.
    
2. That is my pet! I will throw catches of meat balls. It has to open its mouth.
    And then, count!!
